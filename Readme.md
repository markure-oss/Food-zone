# React Native Elements App

![alt text](assets/images/Thiết kế chưa có tên.png)
___
#### Mobile app
This is the Demo app for [React Native Elements](https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements) built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/). The purpose of this app is to demonstrate the usage of the various UI components that React Native Elements provides out of the box.

This app also works on the <code>web</code> platform using [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web). If you are looking to build a React Native mobile app which can reuse the code to deploy it on the web, this is the right place to begin. We decided to use [Expo](https://expo.dev/), which reduces the effort required to build an app once and deploy it anywhere.
